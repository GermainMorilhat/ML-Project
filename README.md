# ML-Project
This repository presents our Machine Learning project. The group of work is composed by:

<ul>
  <li> Alaeddine Ben Fradj</li>
    <li> Germain Morilhat</li>
    <li> Jules Sa√Ødane</li>


  </ul>
  
This project aims to apply Binary Classifcation on two different datasets: 
<ul>
  <li> Banknote Authentication Dataset. This dataset is composed by 1372 instances, with 5 attributes each, and it gives as an output if the Banknote is falsified or not. The purpose will be to train our classification model, to be able to determine if a given banknote is valid or not.
  </li>
  <li> Chronic Kidney Disease. This dataset is composed by 400 instances, with 24 attributes each, and gives as an output if a given patient is suffering from chronic kidney disease or not. We will train our classification model to predict if a new patient is likely to suffer from chronic kidney disease.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>I - Good programming practices </h2>

<p>
Before we start present our work, we think that it is important to deal with the programming pratices that we will use through the project. One the main principle that we will follow will be the use of Git to share and synchronise our work. This will be used to a lesser extent on the code part, since we worked a lot together, and it was therefore easier to work on a single computer.<br> Yet Git was very useful, especially for bug fixes after most of the work was done together, or when writing this report, which is an exercise that allows to separate the work into several parts, which makes the use of a synchronization tool like Git ideal.

Another thing we would like to focus on is the automation of our script, with the objective that the only action of a user trying to use it would be to change the database. For this, we will try to automate the different steps of the project, whether it is during the preprocessing with the cleaning of the data, or afterwards during the training and execution of the model.<br> To prevent bugs from appearing and to facilitate the maintenance of our code, we will also try to separate our code into multiple simple functions, allowing us to avoid a large number of incompatibilities between functions and to reduce the entropy of our script.
